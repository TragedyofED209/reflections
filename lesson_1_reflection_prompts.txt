How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It singled out the lines that had changed from file to file. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Knowing what changes were made when would help in deep bug fixes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    PRO you have more control over when a version is created. CON it's not automatically created so if you forget to commit you could cause conflicts later or introduce new bugs. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    If you're working on a large project with multiple files to create a feature it makes it easier to manage. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see what files were changed and git diff to see the differences between old / new files. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You'll always have a back up point. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Building an app.
