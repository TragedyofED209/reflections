When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git auto stay up-to-date with your remote repository? So changes you've made locally don't get overridden. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instad of another? Fork is a clone of an existing repository that includes all original files but won't include newer changes by the original author. Clone is a copy of an existing repository. Branch is a version of a repository.
